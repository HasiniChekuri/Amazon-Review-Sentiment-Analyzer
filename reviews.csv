It's super easy to use and really effective at relieving muscle tension all over the body. The different settings are great for customizing the intensity depending on how gentle or powerful you want the massage to be.It's lightweight and portable, which means I can take it anywhere with me, even on trips. If you’re looking for a reliable massager that offers full-body relief, this one is definitely worth considering!"

2,Reviewed in India on 6 July 2024,Pramod Sharma,5.0 out of 5 stars,Relaxation at Your Fingertips!,"""The product was working fine at the time of purchase, but after 2 months, it stopped working. When I try to charge it, the light blinks, but then it won't work. It suddenly turns on by itself and I'm unable to turn it off. It's a waste of money, please don't buy it."""

It was still good. Relieved my neck pains.But, now...The light doesn't blink while charging as shown. Stops all of a sudden. And doesn't start."
