3,Reviewed in India on 27 June 2022,Peter,5.0 out of 5 stars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Airpods max: way too expensive, bulky, and hurts the ears after an hour.Beats solo3: expensive and hurts the ears after 40 minutes.Airpods pro: has the rubber on the ends that annoy the ears (good for noise cancellation but not for long term use)Airpods 2: perfect in everything except noise cancellation and sound quality. Battery backup could be better.Airpods 3: brilliant in every way. Does not even feel like you have it in your ears. Packs a punch for its size and give better audio (spatial) as well as better battery backup. Does not have rubber tips which makes it the most comfortable earbuds to me. Worth the upgrade. Prefer this over the new pros which I tried briefly."
4,Reviewed in India on 15 July 2024,Phutanen,4.0 out of 5 stars,,"Apple has done it again with its 3rd Gen AirPods. The best feature and what works best with the Apple Ecosystem is the Spacial Music. Its truly an experience if one is into ardent music lover and has an Apple Ecosystem (IPhone/Mac) subscribed to Apple Music Lossless music.Clarity is music is very good, specially when you are listening to lossless music. The Separation of the instruments can easily be heard. But if one is a bass head, then this is not the one to go with. Sony or Bose is an better option. Also the clarity on calls including the mic is awesome.Fits very well and can be used for long hours and no discomfort or pain felt.Battery life is good so far. I have been charging once in 2 days for a daily usage of upto 6-8 hoursThe only negative about is that it done not filter any outside noise. Of course this does not have noise cancellation feature built-in, bust was expecting some amount of external noise being filtered out when listening to music. It fails there.So if you are mostly in an Apple Ecosystem and not a Bass Head, and Noise Cancellation is not your priority, then AirPods is the way to go"
5,Reviewed in India on 28 July 2024,Sukhpreet Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,UNPOPULAR OPINION: THE BEST AIRPODS TO DATE.,"Are you satisfied with airpods 2 with fit and comfort? If yes then don’t buy Airpods 3 without trying them on.I have seen lot many people saying that Airpods 3 are not as comfortable as airpods 2. Almost 90% of them.I personally used Airpods 2 for more than 2 years and I am Sardar guy and used them while wearing turban. Never had any issue.But Airpods 3 were uncomfortable and painful for atleast week or so. I even decided to return them. But then I thought let’s use them.In terms of Audio and User experience.I was equally satisfied with Airpods 2.But as for as for user experience, Airpods 3 are better. Because they connect faster while in between the call or media play. Airpods sometimes used to miss connecting but it isn’t the case with 3.Now comes to Spatial Audio. If you don’t know exactly what it is. It is Dolby atmos.Spatial Audio has made my Netflix watching experience best. Like if there is raining in the movie, I will feel like it’s raining in my room as well.Airpods 2 don’t have spatial audio but they are also good at audio in movies and will do 70% of the work as of 3.So u won’t miss Spatial Audio if you have Never used it. But I would say it’s worth it.So overall Airpods 3 are good product except fitting.They don’t fit well for almost everyone. So better to go for airpods 2. And if u definitely wanna go for Airpods 3, make sure you try them on for atleast half an hour or so. And also try laughing while wearing them, yes the reason I said laughing, they way my face muscles move while laughing, right earbud comes off which is annoying.So just pick Airpods 2 and save up some money at the end of the day because fitting is definitely an issue. Baaki audio is on point no doubt"

That's a feature you get in 5K earphones these days. Apple thinks it can charge their customers the earth for their products. and those poor sods will lap them all up in the name of 'ecosystem'. What a scandal

8,Reviewed in India on 12 May 2024,San,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great with Apple eco system,"The AirPods Gen 3 has a notable upgrade, delivering improved sound, a secure fit, and seamless connectivity. Despite the absence of active noise cancellation, their integration with the Apple ecosystem and added features like spatial audio and Adaptive EQ make them a worthwhile investment for Apple fans and casual users.It is compatible with windows laptop as well."
